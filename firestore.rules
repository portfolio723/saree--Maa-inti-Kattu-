/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Maa Inti Kattu
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data (profiles, orders) and allows public read access to product and category information. Administrative privileges are granted based on the presence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/products/{productId}`: Public product catalog.
 * - `/categories/{categoryId}`: Public category list.
 * - `/users/{userId}`: User profile (private).
 * - `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}`: User orders (private).
 * - `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}`: Order items for a specific order (private).
 * - `/reviews/{reviewId}`: Product reviews (publicly readable, owner-writeable). Contains denormalized `productId` and `userId`.
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`: Indicates administrative privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access to products and categories.
 * - Strict ownership enforcement for user profiles and orders.
 * - Reviews are publicly readable but can only be created, updated, or deleted by the user who created them.
 * - Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Reviews include denormalized `productId` and `userId` fields to allow efficient authorization checks without additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data (profiles, orders) is stored under `/users/{userId}` to ensure privacy and simplify security rules.

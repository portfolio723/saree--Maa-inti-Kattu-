/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Maa Inti Kattu application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and orders,
 * while allowing public read access to products, categories, and reviews.
 * Administrative privileges for modifying products and categories are not implemented in this prototype.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores orders for a user, accessible only by that user.
 * - /products: Stores product information, publicly readable.
 * - /categories: Stores category information, publicly readable.
 * - /products/{productId}/reviews/{reviewId}: Stores reviews for products, publicly readable,
 *   but only the author can modify/delete their own review.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly denied.
 * - Data validation is minimized in this prototype to allow for rapid schema iteration.
 * - Admin privileges for product/category management are not yet implemented, requiring future expansion.
 * - Timestamp validation is skipped in this prototype.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: Not applicable, as path-based ownership and public read access
 * patterns are used, eliminating the need for denormalization in this prototype.
